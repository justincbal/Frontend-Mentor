## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this challenge I got to really practice using grid layouts. The main issues I was having was having the grid items fill the space I wanted them to, as well as aligning them and sizing them. It took a lot of playing around to figure out what worked. 

### Continued development

I've attempted to use flexbox for some layouts, but ended up switching to grid because I understand grid more and it's easier for me. That being said, for future development I want to go at it again using flex, and try to really learn how to use it properly.
