### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I tried a mobile first approach, and found it easier to create a more responsive layout from there. 

### Continued development

I managed state through useState, but I for future projects I want to try to implement the use of createContext to prevent prop drilling.

Since this was such as small project I didn't see the need to make the switch.
